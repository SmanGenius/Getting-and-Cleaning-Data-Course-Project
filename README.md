# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is a repo for Coursera's "getting and cleaning Data" for final project in week 4. It contains a R code  (run_analysis.R), codebook and tidy data set (tidyData.txt), all of them requiriments to aprove the project.

The data is about a Human Activity Recognition, collected by smarphones of 30 subjects  in their daily activity while the subjects were carrying the smartphone with information of the sensor signals(accelemeter and gyroscope).

In the code run_analysis.R can see how was the procces to clean the data, meeting the requested requirements

1. Merges the train_data and test_data
2. Extracts only mean and std deviation of the measurements
3. Use descriptive names in the activities
4. Apropriately labels with descriptive names in the activities
5. Create a new dataset that have the averange of each measurement variable by user and by activity.

All of this steps are developed in the code, in the codebook you can find a complete description of variables and summaries calculated.
